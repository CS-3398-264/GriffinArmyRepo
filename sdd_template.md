## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document contains the system design description for the Griffin Chess App. Included are the Architectural design and features of the MVC classes, interactions and details of how each class performs. This document will also show how the use cases that were detailed in the SRS are to be implemented using this design pattern.
Primary audiences for this document are the software developers. 

### 1.2 System Overview
Griffin Chess will be written in Java following the Model-View-Controller pattern. This will enable us to seperate the internal state of the application from the class that present that information and interact with the user. The code will take advantage of various design paterns including [LIST DESIGN PATTERNS HERE]. Interfaces and abstract classes will be used to maximize code reuse and streamline the development process.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations
_<List any project definitions and acronyms introduced to the project by this design.>_

### 1.4 Supporting Materials
_<Note any references or related materials here.>_

### 1.5 Document Overview

## 2. Architecture
* cleaned up version of our whiteboard class diagram

_<The architecture provides the top level design view of a system and provides a basis for more detailed design work. This is the section where you should include your High-Level design Component Diagram.>_

### 2.1 Overview
* state diagram
_<This section provides a high level overview of the structural and functional decomposition of the system. Focus on how and why the system was decomposed in a particular way rather than on details of the particular components. Include information on the major responsibilities and roles that the system (or portions of it) must play.>_

### 2.2 Component 1..n
_<Describe an element (subsystem, component, etc...) from architecture in further detail. When appropriate, include information on how the element is further broken down and the interactions and relationships between these subcomponents.>_

## 3. High-Level Design
_<This section describes in further detail elements discussed in the Architecture. Normally this section would be split into separate documents for different areas of the design.>_
_<High-level designs are most effective if they attempt to model groups of system elements from a number of different views.>_

### 3.1 View / Model Component 1..n
_<Provide a description and diagrams of a system component or set of components that describes a clearly defined view or model of the entire system or a subset of the system.>_
